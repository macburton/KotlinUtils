    #Compiling and Running
Kotlin does not have to follow the package to path mappings that Java follows. It is recommended to follow it though.
Kotlin has it's own Compiler that can be installed along with the Kotlin runtime.
Kotlin needs a small run time along with the JRE to run Kotlin generated code.
You can create a executable jar that includes the Kotlin runtime. e.g. to create a jar out of Main.kt use:
    kotlinc Main.kt -include-runtime  -d hello.jar
Run it by using:
    java -jar hello.jar
You can mix Kotlin and Java source files in the same project.
Semicolons are optional in Kotlin.
Kotlin can have more than one main() function per package but only one per file.
Packages in Kotlin can be imported with as keyword:
import java.sql.Date as sqlDate (this will help avoid name comflicts with java.util.Date).

Use interpolation in strings. "Name is : ${name}"
Use triple quotes("""hello""") for strings spanning multiple lines.
if as an expression returning a value.
All of Kotlin's statements act as expressions except for the loops.
Yu can break and continue from loops using labels. labels use @ in their name.
Use when instead of a switch.
Use ranges for loops and list of numbers. You can also create reverse ranges and ranges with steps.
Single line function with no body.
extension functions.
Default parameters, Named parameters for functions.
Spread operator.
